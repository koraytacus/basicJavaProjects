/**
 * Write a program to answer questions like the following:
 * Suppose the species Klingon ox has a population of 100 and a growth rate of
 * 15 percent, and it lives in an area of 1500 square miles. How long would
 * it take for the population density to exceed 1 per square mile?
 *
 * The formula for population density is population divided by area.
 *
 * Test your program with the following values:
 * Population: 100
 * Growth rate: 15%
 * Area: 1500 square miles
